# Design-and-Floorplan-analysis-of-a-Multiplier-using-YOSYS-QFLOW-


Playing a pivotal role in achieving the successful RTL design and floorplan analysis of the Multiplier, the objective was to align it with project goals and ensure seamless integration into the target technology. This involved defining the RTL architecture, specifying behavior, and optimizing performance. Furthermore, synthesis and mapping to standard cells were carried out to efficiently utilize the library. A custom Perl script was created to configure design parameters and enhance flexibility. Pre-layout STA was conducted to assess timing characteristics and identify areas for improvement. Leading the floorplan design was essential to make efficient use of the chip's physical space while meeting specified Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio criteria. Thorough documentation of design decisions, progress, and outcomes was maintained and shared with the team to promote transparency and enable effective collaboration.

1. RTL Design:
I was responsible for the RTL design phase, which involved creating a Register-Transfer Level (RTL) netlist of the 
Multiplier. This process included developing the digital logic design, specifying the desired functionality, and 
optimizing it for performance and area efficiency.
2. Synthesis and Standard Cell Mapping:
I conducted the synthesis process to translate the RTL code into a gate-level netlist. Additionally, I mapped the 
design to standard cell components from the library, resulting in the generation of a Library (LIB) file. This step was 
crucial for implementing the design using standard cells and optimizing it for the target technology.
3. Custom Perl Script for Configuration:
I developed a custom Perl script to configure critical design parameters. This included setting the clock period, 
determining IO port assignments, and configuring drive strength to meet the project's timing, performance, and 
power objectives.
4. Pre-layout Static Timing Analysis (STA):
I executed a pre-layout Static Timing Analysis (STA) to assess the design's timing performance. This analysis was 
essential for identifying the critical path and ensuring that the design met the required critical path delay of 2.5 ns.
5. Floorplan Design:
I led the floorplan design phase, which involved specifying the physical placement of key components within the 
chip. I determined the height and width (400μm and 600μm) of the layout and ensured that it met the project's 
goals, including a Utilization Factor of 54.7% and an Aspect Ratio of 0.66.
